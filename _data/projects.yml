  tagline: "Detecting the invisible contamination in prokaryotic genomes"
  description: |
    Discovered that 15-30% of "high-quality" metagenome-assembled genomes were
    actually chimeras - contamination that existing quality control tools completely
    missed. GUNC detects chimerism by analyzing the lineage homogeneity of individual
    contigs, revealing hidden genome assembly artifacts.
  impact:
    - "Revealed 15-30% of 'high-quality' MAGs were undetected chimeras"
    - "250+ citations since 2021 publication in Genome Biology"
    - "Improved quality standards for prokaryotic genome databases worldwide"
